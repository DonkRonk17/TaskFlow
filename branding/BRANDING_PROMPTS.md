Create a 1:1 app icon for QuickClip in the Beacon HQ suite style: bold central symbol of clipboard (stylized clip or clipboard icon), strong contrast, safe margins, minimal detail that still feels premium, photonic accents, eco-tech feel, no text.

Dimensions: 1024×1024 pixels with safe margins for rounded corners.

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow. Single bold symbol representing universal clipboard. High legibility at small sizes (16px-512px).

Background: Subtle gradient from deep blue to teal from Beacon HQ palette. No transparency needed for icon.

# PROJECT 19: JSONQuery

**Location:** `C:\Users\logan\OneDrive\Documents\AutoProjects\JSONQuery\branding\`

## 19.1 JSONQuery - Title Card

**Filename:** `JSONQuery_titlecard.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Create a Beacon HQ family title card for JSONQuery: Smart JSON/YAML query tool with path queries, filters, search, and statistics - zero dependencies.

Cinematic 16:9 format (3840×2160). Central logo-style wordmark "JSONQuery" integrating JSON querying symbolism (stylized JSON brackets, query path, data extraction).

Background: futuristic eco-tech environment inspired by Beacon HQ, with photonic circuitry lines and premium materials. Minimal, cinematic, ultra-realistic, crisp edges, tasteful glow, no extra text beyond "JSONQuery".

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow, natural greens. Micro-etched glass, brushed metal, luminous circuit filaments, clean eco landscaping. Subtle photonic border or corner rails.

Constraints: No watermarks, no random words, no extra logos, no clutter, no cartoon style, no distorted geometry. CPUs are rare accents only (1-3 small embedded motifs max, never the main subject).

## 19.2 JSONQuery - Logo Mark (1:1)

**Filename:** `JSONQuery_logo_1x1.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Design a Beacon HQ family logo mark for JSONQuery: a simple, high-recognition symbol of JSON querying (stylized JSON brackets, query magnifier, or data path), using Beacon HQ materials and photonic linework.

Clean silhouette, readable at small sizes, optional "JSONQuery" wordmark variant below or beside the symbol, no extra text.

Dimensions: Primary 1:1 (2048×2048).

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow. Micro-etched glass, brushed metal, luminous circuit accents. Ultra clean geometric sans typography for "JSONQuery" wordmark.

Transparent background. Minimal, premium, instantly recognizable as JSON query tool.
